# ScenLang

This is just a very quick tool that I used to write the scenario text for both Star Story and The Fairy Tale REVAMPED.
Due to it's dual setup it allowed me to write both the English and Dutch versions of the same text with ease and with little time.

If this tool is useful to you, then by all means use it. I've put on a GNU General Public License on it, so go ahead, take it.

# DISCONTINUED

This version of ScenLang has been discontinued. A new version of ScenLang has been completely written from Scratch for the Mono Framework with GTK sharp in C# and can be found [here](https://github.com/TrickyGameTools/ScenLang).
This newer version uses "lzma" compression in stead of "zlib" (although "zlib" compressed jcr files can still be read), can be used for more than just two languages (no official limit) and can also export to well-known markup languages such as JSON and XML.
