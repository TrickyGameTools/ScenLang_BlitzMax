# ScenLang

This is just a very quick tool that I used to write the scenario text for both Star Story and The Fairy Tale REVAMPED.
Due to it's dual setup it allowed me to write both the English and Dutch versions of the same text with ease and with little time.

If this tool is useful to you, then by all means use it. I've put on a GNU General Public License on it, so go ahead, take it.
